Input: 

- alpha: 'the probability level vector for VaR and ES'

- index: 'any subset of (''Normal'', ''Laplace'', ''Power-like''), indicating the choice of contamination model' 

- scale: 'the scale vector of the contamination model indicated by index'

- epsilon: 'the contamination level vector'

Output:  'Approximations and its theoretical values of VaR, ES and level ratio of expectile vs. quantile with varying alpha'

Example: 

- 'SRMCappr_alpha.png, plot of the approximations of VaR, ES and w_alpha / alpha with contamination level epsilon = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), 

and scale = (1.6, 1.6, 1) for normal, Laplace and Power-like contaminations'
