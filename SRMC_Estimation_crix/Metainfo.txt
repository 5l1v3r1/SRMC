Description: 'Obtains estimations of parameters involved in the normal-Laplace contaminations by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm

Gives estimations of VaR and ES by historical simulations, based on the Laplace distribution and mixed model. Shows the tails of log returns of CRIX

during 2014.04-2018.01 is heavier than that before, and the approximation based on Laplace at scaled level performs well'

Keywords: 'cryptocurrency, crix, EM, parametric estimations, normal-Laplace mixture, VaR, expected shortfall'
