Description: 'Shows the approximations of VaR, ES with varying alpha and epsilon, a power function of alpha with exponent tau, 

based on the pre-supposed ideal standard normal model, or the contamination model H'

Keywords: 'normal mixture, Laplace, heavy tail, approximation, Expected shortfall, VaR, Huber contamination'

Input: 

- alpha: 'the probability level vector for VaR and ES'

- index: 'any subset of (''Normal'', ''Laplace'', ''Power-like''), indicating the choice of contamination model' 

- scale: 'the scale vector of the contamination model indicated by index'

- tau: 'the power indice alpha to define epsilon, i.e., epsilon = alpha^\tau'

Output:  'Approximations and its theoretical values of VaR, ES of epsilon mixture model with epsilon = alpha^tau'

Example: 

- 1: 'SRMCappr_epsilon_alpha_1.png, approximations of VaR, ES  based on normal model with scale = c(1.1, 1.6, 1)

tau = c(0.5, 1, 1) for normal, Laplace and Power-like contaminations'

- 2: 'SRMCappr_epsilon_alpha_2.png, approximations of VaR, ES  based on contamination model with scale = (1.6, 0.95, 1), tau = (0.5, 0.1, 0.5)

for normal, Laplace and Power-like contaminations'
