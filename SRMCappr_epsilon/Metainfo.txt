Input: 

- alpha: 'the probability level vector for VaR and ES'

- index: 'any subset of (''Normal'', ''Laplace'', ''Power-like''), indicating the choice of contamination model'

- scale: 'the scale vector of the index function'

- epsilon: 'the contamination level vector'

Output:  'Approximations and its theoretical values of VaR, ES and level ratio of expectile vs. quantile with varying alpha'

Example: 'SRMCappr_epsilon.png, plot of approximations of VaR, ES and w_alpha / alpha with alpha = (0.5%, 0.5%, 0.5%), 

and scale = (1.5, 1.5, 1) for normal, Laplace and Power-like contaminations'
